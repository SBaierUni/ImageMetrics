# TODO

ImageCompression:
+ Should -p delete the source files ? -> currently it does
+ Terminal output text for bpg wrong, (changed from 0->51 to 51->0) ->  who cares ?
+ Support decimal digits for comRate in filename ? -> nobody needs that

Plot:
+ adjust scores for better visibility
+ maybe plot all scores of the different images
+ one plot per ratio + format

CSV-File-Format:
filename,srccompRatio,srcformat,comcompRatio,comformat,metric,score
test,10,jpg,20,bpg,psnr,30.324
