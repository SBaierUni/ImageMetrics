# TODO

ImageCompression:
+ Convert into png after finding fitting quality value
	- Attach format and compression ratio to filename e.g. gaben_bpg_30.png
+ Path instead of imageList.txt
	- Load all files from given folder
	- Store all files into given folder
? Should -p delete the source files
? Terminal output text for bpg wrong, changed from 0->51 to 51->0
? Support decimal digits in filename
? Is compRatio for all images the same quality setting?

ImageDatabase:
+ png, lossless
+ ~1920x1080
+ 1000-2000 samples

ImageQuality:
+ Option for choosing metrics, compare folder and reference image
