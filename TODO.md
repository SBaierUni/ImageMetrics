# TODO

ImageCompression:
+ Should -p delete the source files ? -> currently it does
+ Terminal output text for bpg wrong, (changed from 0->51 to 51->0) ->  who cares ?
+ Support decimal digits for comRate in filename ? -> nobody needs that

Plot:
+ plot report.txt with 4 curves(bpg, jp2, jxr, jpg) per reference quality(10, 30)
+ y-axis metrics
+ x-axis score
