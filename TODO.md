# TODO

ImageDatabase:
+ png, lossless jpg
+ ~1920x1080
+ 1000-2000 samples

ImageCompression:
+ Should -p delete the source files ? -> currently it does
+ Terminal output text for bpg wrong, (changed from 0->51 to 51->0) ->  who cares ?
+ Support decimal digits for comRate in filename ? -> nobody needs that
+ Formula for progress bar is wrong
